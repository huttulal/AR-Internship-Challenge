# AR Interactive Engineer Internship Challenge
An internship challenge where Lens Studio and Blender were used to design two AR lens effects with 3D text.

### Challenge Questions:
**1.** Use Lens Studio to design a new lens effect in which we can put 3D AR texts on a surface (for example, ground). You should design the 3D text assets and use the scripting function provided by Lens Studio to create the lens effect.

**2.** Use Lens Studio to design a new lens effect in which we can put 3D AR texts in the sky.
